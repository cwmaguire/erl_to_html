# erl_to_html
Using a parse transform and erl_id_trans.erl to convert erlang code to HTML with spans for _everything_.

## Tests
make tests

## Why do this? (Why not use ______?)

This project started when I started writing a tutorial on Erlang and was
hand-formatting Erlang as HTML. I got curious about using parse
transforms to turn Erlang into HTML.

I get curious about things. When something piques my curiosity I start a
project to explore it. Usually once I get comfortable with the topic
then I end up getting bored and abandoning the project. When I'm getting
paid I have no problem finishing projects and maintaining them but when
it's just a hobby project on github I don't stay motivated.

## License
I have no idea what I need to do license-wise but since I'm copying
erl_id_trans.erl from the Erlang example code I'm using the Erlang
Public License.
